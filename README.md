# FantasyCalendar
This project is something I was building on the side so it is by no means perfect.

This particular version was built on Spigot 1.9. I have a 1.10 version and most likely will end up on here
at some point once a few things have been addressed.

This plugin is designed to represent a basic calendar for any RP server out there wanting to bring some immersion to their server.
It calculates the dates based on where the number of ticks hit. Once the ticks reach 0, it increments the day by 1.

Once the max number of days reaches for the month, the month is then incremented by 1 and so on with the Season. Fairly simple.

However, I hope to eventually add some more functionality to it at a later date.
